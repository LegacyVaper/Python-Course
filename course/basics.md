# **🐍 Python Course 🐍**
Welcome to our Python course! In this course, you will learn everything you need to know about Python programming. 🎉

## **❓ What is Python?**
Python is a popular high-level programming language used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Here's an example of a simple Python program that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen:
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```


## **💻 Installation and Setup**
To start programming in Python, you need to install the Python interpreter and a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). There are many ways to install Python, depending on your operating system and preferences. Here's an example of how to install Python using the command line on a Linux system:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## **🔢 Basic Data Types**
In Python, there are several basic data types, including strings, numbers, and booleans. You'll learn how to use these data types to store and manipulate information. Here's an example of how to define and use a string variable in Python:
```py
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
```

## **🏷️ Variables and Assignments**
Variables are used to store values in Python, which can be updated or modified throughout the program. You'll learn how to create and use variables, and how to assign values to them. Here's an example of how to create and use a variable in Python:
```py
x = 42
y = 3.14
z = "Python"
print(x, y, z)
```

## **⌨️ Basic Input/Output**
Input and output are essential components of any programming language. You'll learn how to get input from users and display output on the screen using Python. Here's an example of how to get input from the user and display output using the print() function in Python:
```py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
